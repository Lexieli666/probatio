# DECISIONS.md — judgement calls made without asking, numbered and dated

## 1. Distribution name `probatio-llm`, import name `probatio`

- **Date:** 2026-09-03 (Phase 0)
- **Q:** What distribution name goes on PyPI, given that spec §2 prefers `probatio` if it is free?
- **A:** `probatio-llm`. The import name stays `probatio`, so every example, docstring and
  `import probatio` line in the spec is unaffected.
- **Why:** The name `probatio` on PyPI is taken by an unrelated placeholder release,
  probatio 0.0.1. That placeholder also installs a top-level `probatio/` import package, so the
  two distributions collide on disk and must never be installed into the same environment. The
  README's install section states this. Decided by the user in the Phase 0 prompt; recorded here
  because spec §2 leaves the name conditional.

## 2. `D` docstring rules apply to `src/` only

- **Date:** 2026-09-03 (Phase 0)
- **Q:** Spec §2 asks for ruff rules `E, F, I, B, UP, N, D` with "D for public API". The gate runs
  `ruff check src tests examples`. Where does `D` apply?
- **A:** `D` is selected globally and ignored per-file for `tests/**` and `examples/**`.
  `E, F, I, B, UP, N` apply everywhere.
- **Why:** "D for public API" means the shipped package. Requiring a docstring on every pytest test
  function and on every line of the demo suite would add noise to the two directories that are read
  as prose examples, and `examples/demo_suite/` is frozen after Phase 1, so a later docstring rule
  change there would be unfixable. Rejected alternative: selecting `D` only under a
  `src/**`-scoped section, which ruff expresses less directly than a per-file ignore.

## 3. A tracked `examples/README.md` so the gate's paths resolve in Phase 0

- **Date:** 2026-09-03 (Phase 0)
- **Q:** The gate command is `ruff check src tests examples`, but `examples/` has no content until
  Phase 1, and ruff exits non-zero with `E902 No such file or directory` on a missing path.
- **A:** Commit a one-paragraph `examples/README.md` that says what will live there. Git cannot
  track an empty directory, and the file is not Python, so it changes nothing that ruff, pytest or
  coverage measure.
- **Why:** Keeps the five gate commands in `CLAUDE.md` runnable verbatim from Phase 0 onward,
  instead of a Phase-0-only variant that a later session might copy by mistake. Rejected
  alternative: dropping `examples` from the Phase 0 CI invocation and adding it in Phase 1, which
  makes the committed CI workflow disagree with the documented gate.
  `pytest`'s `testpaths = ["tests", "examples/demo_suite"]` needs no such placeholder: pytest
  globs testpaths and tolerates an entry that matches nothing.

## 4. Local interpreter is Python 3.13; the floor and the CI matrix are unchanged

- **Date:** 2026-09-03 (Phase 0)
- **Q:** The repository's `.venv` is Python 3.13.5, but spec §2 pins CI to 3.11 and 3.12.
- **A:** Leave `requires-python = ">=3.11"` and the CI matrix at 3.11 / 3.12; develop locally on
  3.13. `mypy` is configured with `python_version = "3.11"` so type checking targets the floor
  rather than the local interpreter.
- **Why:** 3.13 satisfies the declared floor, so no dependency or syntax decision changes; the
  matrix is what proves the floor. Changing the Python floor would need to be asked, and nothing
  here requires it. Rejected alternative: rebuilding the virtualenv on 3.11, which would make the
  local run identical to the older CI leg but hide 3.13 incompatibilities until release.
